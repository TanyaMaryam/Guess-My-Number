# Guess-My-Number

<p>
This game is developed using HTML, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.
The "Guess My Number" game is a simple and interactive number-guessing game where one player (or the computer) selects a secret number within a predefined range, and the other player attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the first player provides feedback, typically indicating whether the guess is "too high," "too low," or "correct." The game continues until the correct number is guessed.

It's a great exercise for practicing logical reasoning and narrowing down possibilities using the process of elimination, often by employing binary search strategies to guess efficiently. The game can be easily adapted for different levels of difficulty by adjusting the range of numbers.
